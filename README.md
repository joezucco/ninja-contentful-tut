This is the Next.js starter site (and course files) for the Next.js & Contentful tutorial by the Net Ninja. Working off of [this video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9mNsYJbkNg&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jClk8wl1yJcN3Zlrr8YSA1). This was super helpful for my capstone project.

## Getting Started

To use the starter project, run the following in a terminal:

```bash
npx create-next-app [your-site-name] -e https://github.com/iamshaunjp/next-contentful/tree/lesson-1-starter-site
```
